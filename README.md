# SoundStorm: Efficient Parallel Audio Generation 

**Work In Progress ...**

SoundStorm is a model for efficient, non-autoregressive audio generation. SoundStorm receives as input the semantic tokens of
AudioLM, and relies on bidirectional attention and confidence-based parallel decoding to generate the tokens of a neural audio codec.
